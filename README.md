# My Python Projects Journey

This is a curated collection of Python projects I’ve built to deepen my understanding of the language and its real-world applications. From simple games to utility tools, each project is a step toward mastering Python for data analytics and automation.

## Why I’m Doing This

As someone with 5+ years of experience as a Business Analyst and a certified PEGA Business Architect, I’m now working toward sharpening my Python skills with the long-term goal of applying them in data analytics, dashboarding, and automation projects. This repo is both my learning log and my project showcase.
